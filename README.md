# Webpages and Sites
Computer Science Progression of Webpages to Websites

Usual Prior Experience
- Simple HTML or CSS

Special Projects and Considerations
- How Mercer's Kitchen mentors DIV II students to create a portfolio using HTML, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Website-Mentoring">Click Here for Website Mentoring</a>
- Creating a Development House's Website Testing Centre with Raspberry Pi's, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Webpages-Sites/blob/master/WebPageTest.pdf">See Website Test</a>

CAUTION: prototyping is the stuff of classroom lessons; moving to a professional feel requires searching and researching other people's work, constantly

# Introduction to HTML5

GitHub Markdown, with Additional HTML rendered in GitHub ReadMe.md files.
- Note, other programs use Markdown for formatting a variety of messages. Markdown is much easier to use if you are used to it or have a "Summary Sheet".
- "Opens a students world to a new type of formatting."
- "Project External Documentation"

Creating Single Page Applications (static or dynamic websites)
- Goal: host at least one through GitHub Website Hosting, further introduction to Google Analytics and Keywords to link to searches
- Using HTML & inline CSS
- "The front end of project promotion."

Modern Examples of Websites, not promotional or business-style, worth researching and learning how to code
- Chrome Extensions: HTML5 (often simple JavaScript), make browser do more
- PWA: Progressive Web Apps, websites that feel like native Android Apps
- Note: can deploy PWAs through Chrome Extension package (Google This)

---

## What is the Internet and Web Documents

Introductions to a Browser - Specifically Google Chrome (and other exist)
1. "What else can a browser do?"
   - https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/use-browser-notepad/, accessed 20180905
   - A Browser can be a notepad tool, as long as the tab stays open
   - Type the following code into the URL Bar

   ```html
   data:text/html, <html contenteditable>
   ```

   - See: https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/use-browser-notepad/ for additional ideas on how to make a browser a Notepad

   - Uses built-in defaults for font, size, and other formatting rules
   - Google will spell check all the typing
   - If Chrome saves tabs (in settings, "Start where you left off"), or you use Workona, Tab will remain ready for notes but typing will disappear

2. Pathways inside a computer
   - Windows, Folders, and Pathways

3. Pathways outside a computer: URLs in name or number
   - Learning how to read URLs
   - Local Scripting: see example of Browser Notepad
   - Local Hosting: see example of World War II Essay on the Holocaust
   - Client-server hosting: see below

Exploring & Illustrating Internet and Web Docs Architecture
- Main Skill Goal: Using CMD through Windows to sending "Packets" or Internet Messages
- Main Concept Goal: diagram image of Internet Architecture (Google Draw, Paper and Pencil, other methods)
  1. One diagram for all vocabulary
  2. Internet Client-Server Requests through 2 stub networks (2x switches with single router)
- Main Vocabulary for Client-server relationships of Real (MAC) Addressing and Logical Addressing
  - workstations & NIC Cards (real MAC Address)
  - stub networks (defined by 1 workstation & switch or 1 workstation & router)
  - LANs defined by switch
  - WANs defined by router (edge router)
  - MANs defined by region or provider
  - Backbone of Internet defined by "in the wild" routers
- Main Vocabulary for Internet Services Requests ("all at once" (Netflix), packets (checked))
  - DNS
  - Pathways
  - Browser
  - EMail Server
  - Print Server
- Main Commands Examples for CMD
  - /? | ?
  - ping
  - traceroute
  - nslookup
  - Note: https://www.cloudns.net/blog/10-most-used-nslookup-commands/, accessed 20180905

Brief Introduction to Web Documents Design: hypertext (HTTP & HTTPS)
- Ports for HTTP & HTTPS for IP Sockets
- Security Protocol of HTTPS

Introductions to Raspberry Pi, "Going Headless", and IP Sockets
- IP Sockets (IP Address : Port Number) needed to specify packet direction

# HTML Lessons


## Simple Reminders

HTML Lessons for the following HTML Features
   - HTML Tags must be included: `<html>, <head>, <body>`
   - `<head>`, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_head.asp">Click Here for W3 Schools Reference</a>
   - `<body>`
     - <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/CS10#html-layout-elements">Click Here for HTML Layout Notes in this document</a>

## Setting up the Chrome Browser for HTML & CSS Validation
- HTML Validation
  - In Workona, point a TAB to https://validator.w3.org/
      - Able to validate hosted and local documents
- CSS Validation

## HEAD Notes

General List of all HTML `<head>`
- `<title>`: title in tab, when added to favorites, displays title in search engine when website is hosted live (i.e. GitHub Hosting)

HTML tags are made up of a few basic components:
Angle Brackets (the greater than & less than symbols “<” & “>”) The  “<>” tells the web browser that “this is an html tag.”
Names: The name of the tag that is usually an abbreviation of a word or phrase that says what it does.
Attributes: attributes are specific to tags and add additional information telling the browser what to do in the context of that tag.
Attribute Values: Very specific information for a tag attribute (don’t worry we’ll show you examples)
Default Values: What the tag will do if no attributes with values are specified.

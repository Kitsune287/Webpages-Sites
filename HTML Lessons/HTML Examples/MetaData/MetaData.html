Web Browsers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser
Find different web browsers, what are the differences
When using most up-to-date languages, browsers are pre-programmed to recognize them.
When the “default changes” then your code might break
Declare what language you are using, like HTML or HTM

HTML Element
Add HTML tags so what is written in-between in known as HTML
This also means we can add more languages into a WYSIWYG
Hint: type it all at once so the ending tag is not forgotten
White Space: SPACEs and TABs that separate the code into something readable by humans, not machines
Sometimes white space is necessary, like in languages like Python, and affect the code, but not in HTML
The compiler reads other syntax instead of White Space

Save the WYSIWYG file as index.html
This means this is the main file. Github looks through a folder of files to search for this one and opens it first
It will be a Landing Page (or other names, like Splash Page, depending on what you have on it. The name tells others your educational background)
Hint: notice the white space

A TITLE appears in the browser’s tab
This gives a little bit more information for you or your reader to know what is being communicated about – 2-5 words about all the pages you have available
Then on the splash page you can have something else
Typing hint: add angle brackets first with the shift key, then type the word without, ending with the END Key to jump to the last line

The rest is for BODY Tags>

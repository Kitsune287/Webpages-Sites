•	Q: what does HTML and CSS Stand for
•	Q: what is the difference between a mark-up language and a computational language

HTML is the language used to create the web pages you visit everyday.
It provides a logical way to structure content for web pages.
Let's analyze the acronym "HTML", as it contains a lot of useful information.
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.
Markup languages work by surrounding raw text with information the computer can interpret, "marking it up" for processing.
HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as “hyperlinks”.
